ultraELF x86-64 assembler, disassembler and metamorphic engine.

A hobby project of mine. Work in progress.

ultraELF is under The GNU General Public License 3, or (at your option)
any later version. See LICENSE file.

All my code copyright (C) 2016 Antti Nuortimo.

ultraELF compiles at least with SBCL (tested with SBCL 1.2.4.debian).
For compiling and loading instructions please see file ultraelf.asd .

All tests pass, except tests related to rep, repz/repe, repnz/repne.
So you should receive a message "15 out of 181 total tests failed" when
running `(test-x64-assembling-functions)` following the instructions
in ultraelf.asd . The reason for this is that rep, repz/repe,
repnz/repne have not been implemented yet.

Implemented functionality:
o Binary code generation for quite many x86-64 instruction encodings.
o Generation of all different functionally equivalent encodings for
  quite many x86-64 instructions.

Future developments underway:
o Code generation for all x86-64 instruction encodings.
o Writing of executable files.
o Disassembler.
o Metamorphic engine.
o Support for x86-16.
o Support for x86-32.
o Support for ARM.
o Support for other CPU architectures.
