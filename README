ultraELF multiarchitecture assembler, disassembler and metamorphic engine.

A hobby project of mine. Work in progress.

ultraELF is under The GNU General Public License 3, or (at your option)
any later version. See LICENSE file.

All my code copyright (C) 2016 Antti Nuortimo.

ultraELF compiles at least with SBCL (tested with SBCL 1.2.4.debian).
For compiling and loading instructions please see file ultraelf.asd .
For manual please see file manual.txt .

All tests pass. So you should receive a message "No tests failed." when
running `(test-parser)` and also `(test-x64-assembling-functions)`
following the instructions in ultraelf.asd .

Implemented functionality:
o Binary code generation for quite many x86-64 instruction encodings.
o Generation of all different functionally equivalent encodings for
  quite many x86-64 instructions.
o Using Common Lisp as a macro language in ultraELF assembler.

Future developments underway:
o Code generation for all x86-64 instruction encodings.
o Writing of executable files.
o Disassembler.
o Metamorphic engine.
o Steganographic assembler.
o Support for x86-16.
o Support for x86-32.
o Support for ARM.
o Support for other CPU architectures.
